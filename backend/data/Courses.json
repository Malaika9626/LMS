Students will learn how to design and build modern, scalable, and secure web applications. Emphasis will be placed on front-end design with React and Tailwind CSS, backend API development with Node.js and Express.js, and data management with MongoDB. By the end of the course, students will be able to develop and deploy a fully functional web application.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nBy completing this course, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the architecture of the MERN stack.\n\nDevelop responsive UIs using React.js and Tailwind CSS.\n\nCreate and consume RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.js.\n\nImplement authentication and authorization using JWT.\n\nStore and manage data with MongoDB.\n\nDeploy applications on cloud platforms (Vercel, Railway, MongoDB Atlas).",
